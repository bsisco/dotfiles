# My dotfiles

Just forked [holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and modified to suit my needs.

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bsisco/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles && rake install
```

**The following is taken verbatim from holman's stuff**
This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`, though.

The main file you'll want to change right off the bat is `zsh/zshrc.symlink`,
which sets up a few paths that'll be different on your particular machine.

You'll also want to change `git/gitconfig.symlink`, which will set you up as
committing as Zach Holman. You probably don't want that.

## topical

Everything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your
forked dotfiles — say, "Java" — you can simply add a `java` directory and put
files in there. Anything with an extension of `.zsh` will get automatically
included into your shell. Anything with an extension of `.symlink` will get
symlinked without extension into `$HOME` when you run `rake install`.
